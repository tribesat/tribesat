"We have lift off!" The TribeSat project is now officially underway, aiming for a launch in October 2018 on the second stage of Orbital ATK's Antares launch vehicle
(catching a ride on an ISS commercial resupply mission).

Stay tuned as we move forward with this project. Follow us on twitter @tribesat.
