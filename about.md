TribeSat is William & Mary's first orbital satellite development program.

Based on the 4" x 4" x 0.5" ThinSat form factor developed by Twiggs Space Lab, we are developing our own payload board. The tethered ThinSat constellations (4 x 3 x 
7 tethers) will be launched into VLEO (very low earth orbit) on the second stage of Orbital ATK's Antares vehicle in October 2018.

Moreover, as an integral part of the program we are including regional high school in the development process. Six high schools will have the opportunity to 
develop and launch their own ThinSat using off the shelf components based on Atmel microprocessors.

Support for TribeSat is provided by:
- MEDO, Meta Economic Development Organisation
- Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (Mars)
- Twiggs Space Lab
- Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC)
- Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority (VCSFA)
